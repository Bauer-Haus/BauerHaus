WindowSmith

<p align="center">
<i>Precision window management for the modern macOS workspace.</i>
</p>


Overview

The Challenge: macOS offers a refined operating system, but its native window management often requires manual resizing and positioning. This can disrupt workflow and create friction, particularly for power users operating across multi-display or ultra-wide monitor setups.

The Solution: WindowSmith is a highly optimized, keyboard-driven window manager and layout utility built natively for macOS. Designed for developers, designers, and multitaskers, it enables instant window snapping into precise grid layouts (Halves, Thirds, Quadrants, or Custom Grids), seamless cross-display window routing, and exact pixel-perfect sizing.

Operating discreetly from the menu bar, WindowSmith is activated instantly via customizable global hotkeys. Whether utilizing a rigid 25/50/25 "Focus" layout for development or a complex custom grid, WindowSmith provides unparalleled control over the macOS desktop environment.

Technical Stack

WindowSmith is built from the ground up to be lightweight, performant, and deeply integrated into the macOS ecosystem.

Language: Swift 5+

UI Frameworks:

SwiftUI: Leveraged for modern, reactive, and fluid interfaces within the Menu Bar popover and Settings modules.

AppKit: Manages low-level window lifecycle events, NSPopover interactions, and global event monitoring.

Core APIs & Frameworks:

ApplicationServices (Accessibility API): The C-based AXUIElement framework powers the core engine, enabling zero-latency reading and manipulation of third-party application windows.

CoreGraphics: Utilized for processing complex multi-monitor bounds, frame calculations, and coordinate geometry.

ServiceManagement: Ensures seamless "Launch at Login" functionality.

Combine: Facilitates reactive state management across the application lifecycle.

Engineering Challenges & Solutions

Building a native macOS window manager requires interacting with deeply embedded, legacy Apple frameworks. Below is an overview of a core technical hurdle overcome during development:

Challenge: Dual-Coordinate Systems & Multi-Monitor Geometry

Window manipulation on macOS requires navigating disparate coordinate systems. AppKit utilizes a bottom-left origin coordinate system (where y=0 represents the bottom of the display), whereas the macOS Accessibility API (AXUIElement) relies on a top-left origin system.

When executing a command to move a window from a primary display to an external monitor of differing resolution, calculating the precise relative geometry requires translating coordinates between these inverted systems, factoring in varied pixel densities, and accounting for the physical arrangement of displays in System Settings (which dictates the global coordinate space).

The Solution

To bypass the latency of standard AppleScript bridges, WindowSmith implements a custom, low-level geometry engine utilizing CoreGraphics and the C-based Accessibility API.

Coordinate Normalization: The engine dynamically queries NSScreen.screens to map the global desktop space. It captures the target window's frame, translates the bottom-left AppKit bounds into a normalized 0.0 to 1.0 relative floating-point ratio, and projects that ratio onto the target monitor's visibleFrame.

Inversion & Injection: Prior to injecting the new coordinates via AXUIElementSetAttributeValue, the engine intercepts the height of the primary screen and mathematically inverts the Y-axis.

Concurrency: To prevent the visual "stuttering" or "rubber-banding" often associated with resizing heavy applications (e.g., Xcode or web browsers), sizing and positioning commands are dispatched asynchronously on a background userInteractive queue. This utilizes a micro-sleep (usleep) buffer, allowing the target application's internal UI thread to synchronize before applying the final coordinate snap.

Result: A window manipulation engine that executes instantaneously and reliably, regardless of the target application or the complexity of the user's monitor configuration.
